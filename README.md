# How to use the booking scraper

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Milena-K/booking-scraper` to download the code
2. Install required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script `python main.py`

After the script successfully completes, check out the data directory for the excel files.

## Notes
I noticed that sometimes the script gets locked, simple scrolling downward helps the script continue.
Maybe it can't locate the button "Load more" because it isn't rendered yet.
